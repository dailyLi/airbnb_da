# Airbnb listings in Toronto

How to manage Airbnb successfully in Toronto? What makes a an expensive Airbnb listing? How to improve review rating?

In this research, we dived into over 10,000 Airbnb listings in Toronto (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) to discover the key factors that affect the price and review rating score. The goal is to provide some insights for potential and existing Airbnb hosts' decision making process when choosing and managing their properties on the website.

Since price and review rating score are continuous variables, we applied linear regression and random forest regressor for modeling. The results revealed that **the number of tenants that can be accommodates at the property** would be the key factor that correlates with the price. In terms of review rating score, the two models yielded different results; what could be concluded in general was that **the host's credibility** (license, verified identity, time of being a host) was critical in review rating score. Further research shall be performed with another round(s) of data cleaning and wrangling, for both attributes and output variables.
